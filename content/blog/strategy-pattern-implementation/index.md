The sun was still rising on a brisk Monday morning in October last year when Sunday Smith, a midwife in New York’s North Country, pulled into the gravel driveway of a small dairy farm, scattering some chickens. She had driven for about ninety minutes, along dark country roads, for a prenatal appointment with Jennifer, who was twenty-nine weeks pregnant with her fourth child. At the front door, an Australian cattle dog named Tickle enthusiastically greeted Smith, followed by Jonathan, Jennifer’s husband. The entire family gathered in the wood-panelled den, with finger paintings on the walls and cartoons flickering on a big television.

Smith has worked for the past two and a half years in the North Country, a sprawling, sparsely populated area that stretches from the Erie Canal to the Canadian border. The area’s Adirondack Mountains pull in some tourists, but not during the long, cold winters. There are a number of colleges, but the students mostly come from elsewhere; otherwise, the population is largely poor, white, and aging. The biggest employer is the Fort Drum military base, which makes the nearby city of Watertown lively enough to include a zoo and a couple of country clubs. Local jobs in mining and manufacturing have been drying up in recent decades, which has helped make the unemployment rate one of the highest of any region in the state. A glut of affordable farmland has lured Amish and Mennonite families, marking a rare source of growth in the region. Traffic signs for tractors and buggies pepper the quiet roads, which are dotted with weathered barns and small churches.

Jennifer was the first of five house calls that Smith had scheduled in the westernmost reaches of her territory, over seventy miles away from her home, in Potsdam. Her clients in this area tend to be either Army wives in prefab homes or devout Christian farmers with big families of homeschooled children. Some days, Smith drives thirty-five minutes north to see mothers on the American side of the Akwesasne Mohawk reservation. Other days, she drives ten minutes west to see undocumented Central American women in a trailer on a three-thousand-acre commercial dairy farm. She has delivered a couple of their babies, but mostly what these women want from her are birth-control shots, because getting pregnant could cost them their jobs.
